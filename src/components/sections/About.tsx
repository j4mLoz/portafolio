        <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
          I approach software development with an architectural mindset. Every
          system I design is built for scalability, maintainability and
          long-term growth.
        </p>

        <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
          My focus goes beyond writing code. I analyze problems, define
          structured solutions and implement systems aligned with business
          objectives.
